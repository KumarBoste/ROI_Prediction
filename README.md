#  Training Effectiveness & ROI Prediction System

This project predicts **Post-Training Score**, **Performance Gain**, and **Return on Investment (ROI)** for employee training programs.  
It uses a **two‚Äìstage machine learning pipeline**:

1. **Model 1:** Predicts **Post-Training Score** from employee & training features.
2. **Model 2:** Uses the predicted Post-Training Score to estimate **ROI**.

This allows HR and L&D teams to evaluate the **impact & cost-efficiency of training programs** before execution.

## Models Used

| Stage | Model | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Model 1 | XGBoost (Regressor) | Predicts Post-Training Score |
| Model 2 | LGBM (Regressor) | Predicts ROI using score + cost features |

Both models use:
- **One-Hot Encoding** for categorical variables  
- **Standard Scaling** for numerical data  
- **Pickled Preprocessors** to ensure consistent inference
